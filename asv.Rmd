# Autonomous Surface Vehicle {style="text-align:center;"}

***Goal: low-cost ASV for ecological monitoring***

This is a 3D printed autonomous surface vehicle. Users can program with a GPS waypoint mission or alternatively control the vehicle remotely.  The vehicle is equipped with data logging capabilities and depth, temperature and pressure sensors. A bathymetry map of the local river was created.
