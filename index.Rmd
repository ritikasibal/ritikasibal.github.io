I graduated in 2020 from the University of Michigan with a ***bachelor’s in computer engineering***. After graduating I worked as an embedded engineer at Apple and later Atomic Technologies. I recently graduated from Boston University with a research-based ***master’s in ecology, evolution, and behavior***.

This website showcases my research experience, personal projects, and interests. If you would like to contact me, feel free to reach out at [ritikasibal2@gmail.com](mailto:ritikasibal2@gmail.com)!
