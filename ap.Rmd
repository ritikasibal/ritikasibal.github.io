***Goal: Copy-cat 3D printed robotic hand that mimics motion in x plane and finger flexing***

How does it work?

The user wears a glove retrofitted with sensors and an MCU that communicates over the air while standing in front of an Xbox Kinect sensor. The Kinect picks up the userâ€™s x-plane motion and the flex sensors on the gloves pick up finger flexing motion. 

Data is then sent to remote robotic hand.

The 3D-printed robotic hand is mounted on a linear actuator to mimic motion in the x plane, the fingers are all individually controlled by high-torque servo motors. Users can record motion and play back motion at a later time.
