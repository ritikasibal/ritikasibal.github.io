# A custom wheelchair for rocky! {style="text-align:center;"}

***A affordable and easily adaptable wheelchair for a growing, adventurous lamb***

When I met Rocky, he was a 3 month old kid. He clearly had an adventurous spirit but had a hard time moving around. Inspired by YouTube videos of cute dogs in wheelchairs, I tried to build Rocky his own by utilizing my 3D printing knowledge.

Sheila, the founder of Alma Bonita Animal Rescue, was all for it! She thought it would be beneficial to have a low cost, adaptable wheelchair while Rocky fully matured.
